# arcbox

Python SDK for ArcBox sandboxes: isolated microVMs on your Mac, driven
over the local daemon's Unix socket with the Connect protocol. Requires
Python ≥ 3.10.

```sh
uv add arcbox        # or: pip install arcbox
```

## Hello world

With the daemon running (`abctl daemon start`):

```python
from arcbox import Sandbox

# Local daemon over ~/.arcbox/run/arcbox.sock — zero config.
with Sandbox.create("", ttl=300) as sandbox:
    sandbox.files.write_text("/tmp/hello.txt", "hello from arcbox\n")

    check = sandbox.commands.run(["/bin/cat", "/tmp/hello.txt"])
    print(check.expect().stdout, "→ exit", check.exit_code)

    job = sandbox.commands.run("for i in 1 2 3; do echo line$i; done", background=True)
    for chunk in job.output:
        print(chunk.data.decode(), end="")
    print("background job exited", job.wait_for_exit().exit_code)
# context exit: sandbox killed, nothing leaked
```

Async is a first-class mirror (`AsyncSandbox`, `async with`, `async for`):

```python
from arcbox import AsyncSandbox


async def main() -> None:
    sandbox = await AsyncSandbox.create("", ttl=300)
    async with sandbox:
        await sandbox.files.write_text("/tmp/hello.txt", "hello from arcbox\n")
        result = await sandbox.commands.run(["/bin/cat", "/tmp/hello.txt"])
        print(result.expect().stdout)
```

Non-zero exit is data (`result.exit_code`), never an exception —
`result.expect()` (or `run(..., check=True)`, `subprocess.run`-style) is
the opt-in raise. Every daemon error maps to a typed class in
`arcbox.errors` (`SandboxNotFoundError`, `CapabilityError`,
`ConnectionFailedError`, ...) carrying a machine-readable `code`, an
actionable `suggestion`, and the failed `operation`. Time arguments are
seconds (floats) everywhere.

## Connection

Resolution order: explicit option > environment > default.

| Environment      | Meaning                                                                                       |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ARCBOX_SOCKET`  | daemon Unix socket (default `$ARCBOX_DATA_DIR/run/arcbox.sock`; data dir default `~/.arcbox`, or `~/.arcbox-dev` under `ARCBOX_PROFILE=development`) |
| `ARCBOX_API_URL` | explicit remote daemon endpoint; requires your own proxy in front of the local socket        |
| `ARCBOX_API_KEY` | bearer credential, attached as `Authorization` when set; unused by the local daemon           |

Every entry point takes a `connection=Connection(...)` slot
(`socket_path` / `api_url` / `api_key` / `request_timeout` / injected
`http_client` for mocking — pass an `httpx.Client` to the sync surface,
an `httpx.AsyncClient` to the async one).

The `Sandbox` / `AsyncSandbox` classmethods resolve a hidden connection
per call, and the returned handle closes its HTTP client on context
exit. Long-lived programs should hold an `ArcBox` / `AsyncArcBox`
instead: it is a context manager (or call `.close()` / `.aclose()`),
and every handle it creates shares its client. An injected
`http_client` always belongs to the caller and is never closed by the
SDK.

## E2B-compatible surface

`arcbox.e2b` serves the [`e2b`](https://e2b.dev) SDK's shape, so existing
E2B code runs against the local daemon with one import change:

```python
from arcbox.e2b import Sandbox  # was: from e2b import Sandbox

sandbox = Sandbox.create(timeout_ms=300_000)
sandbox.files.write("/tmp/hello.txt", "hello\n")
print(sandbox.commands.run("cat /tmp/hello.txt").stdout)
sandbox.kill()
```

`AsyncSandbox` mirrors it, as in `e2b`. No API key and no network: E2B's
cloud arguments (`api_key`, `domain`, `access_token`, ...) are accepted
and ignored, so an app that reads `E2B_API_KEY` from its environment
keeps working.

Most of the surface is a rename. These behaviours genuinely differ:

- **Time is milliseconds here**, as `e2b` counts it, converted to this
  SDK's float seconds at that one boundary.
- **`get_host(port)` needs the port exposed first.** E2B fronts every
  sandbox port with an edge proxy at `{port}-{id}.e2b.app` and so can
  answer for a port nobody declared; ArcBox forwards on request, so
  `sandbox.expose_port(3000)` comes first and `get_host(3000)` is
  synchronous from there on. An un-exposed port raises rather than
  returning an address nothing is listening on.
- **`set_timeout` replaces rather than extends.** E2B only pushes the
  deadline out; ArcBox re-arms it from now.
- **`'base'` and an omitted template** both resolve to the built-in
  minimal template. Other names come from the local catalog, not E2B's
  registry.
- **`files.get_info().owner`/`.group` are numeric** — the daemon reports
  uids and gids, and inventing a name would not be honest.
- **`commands.list()` reports ids only** — the daemon does not report
  argv, so `cmd`/`args`/`envs` are empty rather than invented.
- **`watch_dir(...).stop()` is best-effort in the sync flavor** — a
  pumping thread cannot be interrupted mid-read; the daemon thread ends
  when the watch stream does. The async flavor cancels for real.
- **The exception classes are aliases of `arcbox.errors`'**, not new
  subclasses, so `except SandboxException` matches what the SDK raises.
  `CommandExitException` is real and is raised by `commands.run()` on a
  non-zero exit, as in E2B.
- **Only the instance form of `kill()` exists.** `e2b` carries
  `Sandbox.kill(sandbox_id)` and `sandbox.kill()` under one name, which
  Python cannot express; reach a sandbox you do not hold through
  `Sandbox.connect(sandbox_id)` first.

Anything with no local counterpart raises `UnsupportedException` on the
first call rather than failing quietly: `fork`, volumes, signed
upload/download URLs, `get_metrics`, the MCP gateway, the `Template`
build DSL, and `git.dangerously_authenticate`. `NotEnoughSpaceException`,
`RateLimitException`, `GitAuthException`, `GitUpstreamException`,
`BuildException`, `FileUploadException` and `VolumeException` are
exported so existing imports resolve, but a local daemon has no quota,
no registry build and no volumes, so nothing raises them.

## Development

Inside the arcbox repo (`sdk/python`):

```sh
uv sync                                  # create .venv from uv.lock
uv run python scripts/gen_proto.py       # regenerate src/arcbox/_gen from ../../rpc/arcbox-protocol/proto
uv run python scripts/gen_sync.py        # regenerate src/arcbox/_sync from src/arcbox/_async
uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check .
uv run pyright
uv run pytest                            # includes the sync-tree lockstep + parity checks
```

Generated code under `src/arcbox/_gen/` is committed and is **never**
exported from the package — public shapes are hand-written and mapped
at the transport boundary.

The async tree (`src/arcbox/_async/`) is the source of truth; the sync
tree (`src/arcbox/_sync/`) is generated from it by an unasync token
transform and committed. Edit only the async tree, then rerun
`scripts/gen_sync.py`. Lockstep is CI-enforced twice: the transform is
rerun and diffed (`scripts/gen_sync.py --check`, also wired into
pytest), and a parity test asserts identical public surfaces modulo
async markers.

Optional pre-commit hooks (scoped to `sdk/python`), via
[prek](https://github.com/j178/prek) or classic pre-commit:

```sh
prek install -c sdk/python/prek.yaml
```

The end-to-end hello-world loop runs only against a live daemon and is
opt-in:

```sh
ARCBOX_SDK_E2E=1 uv run pytest tests/test_e2e.py
```

## Toolchain notes

- **uv** is the package/project manager (`uv_build` backend, `uv.lock`
  committed). Publishing is CI-only: `uv build`, then upload via
  `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish` under PyPI trusted publishing (OIDC,
  with PEP 740 attestations — `uv publish` emits none, astral-sh/uv#15618)
  — see [Releasing](#releasing); no `UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN` anywhere.
- **ruff** is both linter and formatter (`E,F,W,I,UP,B,SIM,RUF`).
- **pyright** (strict) is the authoritative type checker. Evaluated
  alternatives (2026-08): **ty** 0.0.65 reports 16 false positives here
  (all `unresolved-attribute` on protobuf generated-module members) —
  kept in dev-deps for `uv run ty check`, may replace pyright when it
  stabilizes; **pyrefly** 1.2.0 passes cleanly (it imports the pyright
  config) and serves as an informational second opinion — one
  authoritative checker avoids double-suppression drift.
- **msgspec** parses the SDK's one JSON seam — Connect error bodies and
  `EndStreamResponse` frames — as typed, validated Structs at the
  untrusted-input boundary (chosen for the typed decoding, not speed).
- Message types are upstream **protobuf** runtime code generated by the
  protoc bundled with grpcio-tools (dev-dep); the bundled protoc version
  matches the pinned runtime.
- A future native-acceleration path (if profiling ever demands one) is a
  **maturin**/PyO3 extension crate in this repo's workspace; nothing in
  the current SDK needs it.

The development gates (ruff check + format, pyright, the
`gen_sync.py --check` lockstep gate, pytest) run on every PR as the
`sdk-python` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, from a
`uv sync --locked` environment.

## Releasing

The SDK is a release-please component (`sdk-python` in
`release-please-config.json`), released on its own cadence, independent
of the main arcbox release train:

1. Conventional commits touching `sdk/python` accumulate on `master`.
2. release-please maintains a dedicated release PR for the component
   (separate from the root and sdk-typescript PRs) that
   bumps the `pyproject.toml` version and updates `CHANGELOG.md`.
3. Merging that PR creates the GitHub release and the tag
   `sdk-python-vX.Y.Z` (same convention as `sdk-typescript-vX.Y.Z`).
4. The tag is what a PyPI publish workflow
   (`.github/workflows/release-sdk-python.yml`) triggers on: it checks
   out the tag's tree, re-runs the full gate suite (`ruff check`, `ruff
   format --check`, `pyright`, `pytest`, `gen_sync.py --check`), builds
   with `uv build`, and publishes via `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish` under
   [trusted publishing](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/) (OIDC,
   PEP 740 attestations included) —
   tokenless: the job's `id-token: write` permission is exchanged for a
   short-lived PyPI credential. The job skips cleanly if the version is
   already on PyPI, so a re-dispatch never fails on an
   already-published release.

> A tag minted while the publish workflow was absent (or a tag whose
> run failed) is **not replayed** by a later push — re-dispatch the
> workflow against the existing tag instead (it takes the tag as a
> `workflow_dispatch` input), never publish by hand: a hand publish
> would need an API token, which the pending-publisher bootstrap below
> exists to avoid.

One-time bootstrap — unlike npm, PyPI supports [pending
publishers](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/creating-a-project-through-oidc/):
the trusted publisher is registered *before* the first upload and CI
does the first publish, so there is no local bootstrap publish and no
API token at any point:

1. On pypi.org → account → Publishing → "Add a new pending publisher"
   (GitHub): PyPI project name `arcbox`, owner `arcboxlabs`, repository
   `arcbox`, workflow filename `release-sdk-python.yml`, environment
   left empty. Empty is deliberate: PyPI calls the environment
   ["optional but strongly
   recommended"](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/creating-a-project-through-oidc/),
   but its value is the [protection
   rules](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/security-model/) an
   environment can carry (required reviewers gating a publish), and
   this repo configures none — naming one today would add a label, not
   a gate. Add the environment and a matching `environment:` key in the
   workflow together with the reviewer rule, not before.
2. The first tag-triggered run then creates the `arcbox` project on
   PyPI as it publishes, and the pending publisher becomes the
   project's regular trusted publisher.

A pending publisher does not hold the name: PyPI ["does not create a
project or reserve a project's name until it is actually used to
publish"](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/creating-a-project-through-oidc/),
and if someone else registers `arcbox` first the pending publisher is
invalidated. `arcbox` is short, generic, and still unclaimed — do the
first publish promptly after registering, and re-check the name is free
if the bootstrap has been sitting for a while.

## Status

Phases 2a and 2b of CORE-58, on both the sync and async surfaces.
Shipped:

| Surface | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `Sandbox` create/connect/list, `kill`/`pause`/`info` | pause/resume are live daemon-side (CORE-21); data-plane calls auto-resume a paused sandbox |
| `commands.run` | foreground result + background handle; `stdin=str\|bytes` (write-then-close) or `stdin=True` (keep open); `pty=PtySize(cols, rows)` |
| `CommandHandle` | streamed `output` with transparent offset-resume across stream death (bounded retries → `ConnectionLostError`), `wait_for_exit`, `kill`, `write_stdin`/`close_stdin`/`stdin_status` (offset-idempotent), `resize` |
| `handle.wait_for_log(pattern)` | first log line matching a substring/compiled regex, SDK-side over the replayed offset-addressed output (resumes across drops); deadline → `TimeoutError` naming the knob |
| `commands.get(id)` / `commands.list()` | re-attach a handle by execution id (stdin cursor seeded from the daemon); list running and exited executions as `CommandInfo` summaries |
| `sandbox.events()` | typed lifecycle events, keepalives filtered; sync reads genuinely block; a mid-stream drop is `ConnectionLostError` |
| `sandbox.set_lifecycle()` | tri-state: omitted (`UNCHANGED`) = unchanged, `None` = restore default (as on `create`), value = replace |
| `arcbox.capabilities()` | daemon handshake (version/protocol/features/nested virt), cached per client |
| `files` | whole-file read/write; path verbs `stat`/`list`/`mkdir`/`remove`/`move` (frozen `FileStat` dataclass, `mkdir -p` semantics, `FileNotFoundError` with the path in context); every path accepts `str` or `PurePosixPath` |
| `files.watch(path)` | typed `FsEvent` stream via `AsyncFileWatch`/`FileWatch` context managers (renames paired, keepalives filtered); ends cleanly on sandbox stop; a mid-stream drop is `ConnectionLostError` — never auto-reconnected (events cannot be replayed) |
| `ports.wait_for_port(port)` | guest-side listen-table wait (no client polling); expiry → `TimeoutError` naming the `timeout` knob (daemon default 30 s, cap 600 s) |
| `ports.expose(port)` / `unexpose` / `list` | publish a guest port on host loopback (daemon-allocated or specific host port, tcp/udp); `list` reads the daemon's authoritative live listener table |
| `sandbox.checkpoint()` | pause + snapshot + resume under the same id; returns the frozen `Snapshot` catalog row |
| `ArcBox.restore(snapshot_id)` | new READY sandbox from a snapshot (fresh client-minted id; `fresh_network=True` for concurrent restores); plus `list_snapshots` (auto-paginating) and `delete_snapshot` |
| `Template.build(name, ...)` | build a catalog template from exactly one source (`image=` local Docker ref, `dockerfile=` inline content, `snapshot=` checkpoint promotion) with default limits/cmd/env, a ready probe (`ready_probe_port=` or `ready_probe_command=`), and `prewarm=True` for a boot-to-READY warm snapshot; no client deadline — builds block as long as they need |
| `Template.get/list/delete_reference`, instance `publish(version)`/`delete()` | resolve `name[:version]` (bare name = newest published, else draft), auto-paginating list, delete a version or the whole template; `publish` freezes the draft immutably |
| `create(template=Template \| "name[:version]")` | a `Template` instance pins its exact reference; template defaults are inherited unless overridden (`vcpus`/`memory_mib` replace limits wholesale; `no_default_cmd`/`no_default_env` suppress inherited cmd/env) |

Deferred: the SDK-side default idle-reaping policy (design decision 4).
