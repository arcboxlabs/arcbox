//! The guest's own declaration that the distro's init has finished booting.
//!
//! A Machine runs an upstream distro image whose init starts *after* the
//! agent — the boot shim runs `machine-init`, backgrounds the agent, then
//! `exec`s `/sbin/init` — and that init typically reconfigures the network
//! from scratch, flushing the interface the shim already configured. The host
//! gates machine readiness on this signal so `Start` does not return into
//! that window (CORE-66).
//!
//! The signal is a sentinel written by a hook ordered at the end of the
//! distro's own boot sequence, not an inspection of the init system's runtime
//! state. That follows what comparable runtimes do:
//!
//! - **Lima** polls `/run/lima-boot-done` for the instance id, written by the
//!   boot scripts it injects (`pkg/hostagent/requirements.go`).
//! - **Multipass** waits on cloud-init's `/var/lib/cloud/instance/boot-finished`
//!   (`base_virtual_machine.cpp`, `wait_for_cloud_init`).
//! - **Incus** has the guest declare itself: `PATCH /1.0 {"state":"Ready"}` on
//!   the devIncus socket, recorded as `volatile.last_state.ready` — documented
//!   as "Instance marked itself as ready".
//!
//! None of them read the init system's internals from outside, and the reason
//! shows up immediately when you try: `/run/openrc/rc.starting` is absent both
//! *before* openrc runs and *after* it finishes, so the obvious check reports
//! "settled" during exactly the window it exists to catch. Unit ordering is a
//! public contract; a runtime directory's layout is not.
//!
//! cloud-init would be the standard vehicle, but the images ArcBox mirrors are
//! the linuxcontainers `default` variant, which does not ship it (verified: an
//! `ubuntu-noble` machine boots with no cloud-init at all). The hook is
//! installed directly instead, which the writable overlay already allows —
//! `machine-init` writes `/etc/resolv.conf` and the DHCP script the same way.
