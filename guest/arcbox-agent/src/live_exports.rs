//! Discovery half of the live-container NFS view (ABX-424).
//!
//! A running container's merged rootfs is an overlay mount, and the docker
//! data mount is bind-propagated into the NFS export root, so every container
//! already appears at
//! `/run/arcbox/nfs-export/docker/rootfs/overlayfs/<container id>` without any
//! bind of its own. What it does *not* have is an `/etc/exports` entry, and
//! NFSv4 will not cross into an unexported child mount — the host sees the
//! empty directory the overlay is mounted over, which reads as "the container
//! has no files" rather than as an error.
//!
//! `crossmnt` would cross automatically and is banned: it SIGSEGVs the
//! shipped `rpc.mountd`, leaving a zombie whose name still satisfies the
//! respawn guard, after which every export upcall goes unanswered and the
//! host's `mount_nfs` wedges in uninterruptible sleep with no diagnostics. So
//! each mount gets an explicit entry, and something has to notice them coming
//! and going.
//!
//! **Departures need no ordering.** Measured 2026-08-17: an export entry does
//! not pin its mount — `docker rm -f` unmounts a currently-exported rootfs
//! without complaint. So this can be driven entirely by watching the mount
//! table, with no container-lifecycle event source and no requirement to
//! unexport before dockerd tears a container down. (An earlier spike concluded
//! the opposite, but that was with `crossmnt` in play.)
//!
//! This module is the pure half — parsing and naming — kept out of
//! `agent/linux/` on purpose so its tests run on a macOS dev host too.
