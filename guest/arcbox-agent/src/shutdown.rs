//! Guest shutdown sequence.
//!
//! When the host requests a graceful shutdown over vsock, the agent calls
//! [`poweroff`]. How the VM is powered off depends on whether the agent is PID 1:
//!
//! - Under **busybox init** (the normal boot path) the agent is a supervised
//!   child, so it asks PID 1 to power off (`SIGUSR2`); busybox init then stops all
//!   children, syncs, and halts the VM. A direct `reboot(POWER_OFF)` is the
//!   fallback if PID 1 does not power off in time.
//! - In **legacy standalone** boot (the agent is run directly as PID 1, e.g. the
//!   e2e harness) the agent drives shutdown itself: terminate every process, sync,
//!   and `reboot(LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_POWER_OFF)` (PSCI SYSTEM_OFF on ARM64).
