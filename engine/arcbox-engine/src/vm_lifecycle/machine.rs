//! The VM lifecycle as a `statig` hierarchical state machine.
//!
//! This is the **decision core**: handlers are pure transition logic that emit
//! [`Effect`]s into the externally-owned [`Effects`] context. They never touch
//! the hypervisor, spawn tasks, or block — all I/O is performed by the lifecycle
//! actor (see `actor.rs`), which owns the `Effects` buffer, reads it after every
//! `handle_with_context`, and applies the effects. The machine therefore holds
//! no `Arc<MachineManager>`, channels, or timers, so the whole transition table
//! is testable with nothing but an `Effects` scratch buffer.
//!
//! ## State hierarchy
//!
//! ```text
//! managed                                 ForceStop / Failure (anywhere)
//!  ├─ booting ── creating, starting       AgentReady → running
//!  ├─ active  ── running, idle            Stop → stopping; IdleTimeout ⇄ Activity
//!  ├─ stopping                            Stopped → stopped
//!  ├─ removing                            Removed → not_exist
//!  └─ resting ── not_exist, created,      Start → creating | starting
//!                stopped, failed
//! ```
//!
//! `Stop` during `booting` is not a machine transition: the actor defers it
//! until the boot resolves (see `actor.rs`).
