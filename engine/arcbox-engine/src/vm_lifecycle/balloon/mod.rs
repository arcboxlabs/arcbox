//! Idle balloon policy (pure logic) and the controller that applies it.
//!
//! Numeric policy lives here; [`controller`] owns the balloon as a
//! message-driven task. The split keeps every decision unit-testable.
//!
//! Invariants (from the 2026-07-15 idle-thrash incident, where a blind
//! shrink to 128 MB starved a running compose stack for 18 hours):
//!
//! - Never shrink without a fresh guest memory reading. An unreachable
//!   agent means we know nothing about guest load — keep the balloon.
//! - The idle target tracks actual guest usage plus headroom; it is never
//!   an unconditional constant. A guest that is actively *working* (load)
//!   is not idle at all, no matter how quiet the host-side API is.
//! - Entry-time stats are the only ones used for sizing: they are taken
//!   while the balloon is empty, the one state where `/proc/meminfo` is
//!   unambiguous under both virtio-balloon accounting modes (with and
//!   without `DEFLATE_ON_OOM`). While shrunk, the balloon perturbs the
//!   very numbers a host-side re-computation would need, so pressure
//!   detection is delegated to the guest (see `WatchMemoryPressure`)
//!   and the only moves are "keep" or "give it all back".
//! - **Idle shrinking runs only on reclaim-capable backends — and no macOS
//!   backend is one today.** VZ (2026-07-29, macOS 26.4): Apple neither
//!   deallocates nor `madvise`s the pages the guest gives up — a 15.35 GB
//!   inflation left the daemon's `phys_footprint` byte-identical, and
//!   under real host memory pressure the kernel *compressed* the ballooned
//!   pages as live data (calibrated against a `MADV_FREE` probe, which the
//!   same pressure discards within seconds). HV: since 2026-09-25 its
//!   device releases reported ranges by refreshing their stage-2 mapping
//!   (`virt/arcbox-vmm/src/vmm/darwin_hv/page_release.rs`), and the
//!   guest's free page reporting drains idle memory back to the host
//!   *without any host-side target* — so the descent below has nothing to
//!   add there either, and the gate stays closed on HV by design rather
//!   than by inability. See [`controller::BalloonDeps::reclaim_capable`];
//!   flip a backend only with a measured host footprint drop on inflate.
//! - **What the host actually pays is the high-water mark of guest-touched
//!   pages, not the configured `memory_mb`** (2026-08-01, VZ, macOS 26.4).
//!   A fresh idle 16 GB VM costs ~718 MB of host `phys_footprint`; the
//!   guest allocating 3 GB of tmpfs takes it to 3717 MB, and the guest
//!   freeing that memory leaves it at 3717 MB. On VZ the mark only
//!   ratchets upward, which is precisely the cost a working balloon would
//!   release. Measure the XPC helper process
//!   (`com.apple.Virtualization.VirtualMachine`) on VZ, not the daemon —
//!   guest RAM lives there, which is also why VZ can never be made
//!   reclaim-capable: that memory is not ours to release. On HV the guest
//!   RAM is the daemon's own mapping and page reporting releases it, so
//!   the daemon's footprint follows the guest's free memory back down.
//!
//! # Before re-enabling the host-driven descent, read this
//!
//! The descent below (probe → stage a target → watch guest pressure) is
//! dormant, not merely unused, and two independent attempts to tune it
//! (2026-07-21, 2026-07-31) were abandoned for the same reason: **it has
//! no backend to serve.** VZ can never be reclaim-capable (above). HV
//! advertises `VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_REPORTING`, its guest kernel enables page
//! reporting, and since 2026-09-25 the host releases every reported range
//! (`virt/arcbox-vmm/src/vmm/darwin_hv/page_release.rs`), so an HV guest
//! hands idle memory back *on its own, continuously* with the guest
//! driving; a host-side idle descent is the wrong shape for it, not a
//! missing piece. Delete this machinery before you tune it.
//!
//! If a descent is nevertheless the answer for some future backend, both
//! measured failure modes must be designed out first:
//!
//! - **`used + IDLE_BALLOON_HEADROOM` degenerates in exactly the idle case
//!   it exists for.** An idle guest has `MemAvailable ≈ total`, so
//!   `used ≈ 0` and the target collapses onto [`IDLE_BALLOON_FLOOR`] — an
//!   unconditional constant, which is what the invariant above forbids.
//!   Measured 2026-07-29 (VZ, 16 GB, before the gate closed): the descent
//!   asked the guest for 15.8 GB of its 15.96 GB available, pinned
//!   `MemAvailable` at literally 0 for ~98 s, pressure-restored, and
//!   repeated every ~8.5 min — ~2.8 cores averaged while "idle", with every
//!   running container an OOM candidate inside each zero-available window.
//!   A target that cannot walk the guest to the edge needs two floors, not
//!   one: a working reserve above `used` (~1 GiB) *and* a cap on how much
//!   of the observed slack a single entry may take (~half). A reclaim too
//!   small to repay its guest-side cost (~512 MB) should not happen at all.
//! - **On a memory-pressured host the descent oscillates, and macOS gives
//!   no signal to gate on.** Inflation churns guest pages through exhausted
//!   host swap and stalls, the guest floods `Out of puff!`, the pressure
//!   watch times out, the controller fails open (restore + note activity),
//!   and the 5-minute idle timeout starts the cycle again. Measured
//!   2026-07-21: an idle 16 GiB System VM on a host at 113/128 GiB with swap
//!   full oscillated every 5 minutes for over an hour — 5477 `Out of puff`
//!   lines in one daemon log — while `kern.memorystatus_vm_pressure_level`
//!   read *normal* throughout. A host-pressure gate is therefore not
//!   available; the only signal-agnostic answer measured was backing off on
//!   consecutive fail-opens (10 min, doubling to an hour) and clearing the
//!   streak when a shrink holds.
