//! The balloon controller: single owner of the idle balloon.
//!
//! A message-driven task, commanded by the lifecycle actor on state
//! transitions (`EnterIdle` on entering `Idle`, `ExitIdle` on leaving it
//! for any reason). Every hypervisor balloon call happens here, serially —
//! no shared balloon state, no cross-task races.
//!
//! Modes:
//!
//! ```text
//! Active ──EnterIdle──▶ probe guest (entry_decision)
//!    ▲                     ├─ NotIdle ──activity()──▶ Active

//!    │                                                  │  shrink: next step,
//!    │        pressure / watch error / silence ≥ 25s    │  fresh watch ──────┘
//!    └────── restore full + activity() ◀───────────┬────▼
//!                                                  └─ Polling (30s stats,
//!                                                     step on healthy poll,
//!                                                     fail open on silence)
//! ```
//!
//! The descent is staged ([`super::SHRINK_STEP`] per move) because inflation
//! speed is not under host control and each step's scarcity window should be
//! short; the guest's `SETTLED` frame gates each further step.
//!
//! Exits always ride the lifecycle state machine: pressure and fail-open
//! paths restore full memory immediately, then note activity, which exits
//! `Idle` and resets the 5-minute idle clock — so a re-shrink requires a
//! fresh quiet period plus a fresh entry probe. Oscillation is structurally
//! impossible.
