//! Interactive debug-console RX worker thread.
//!
//! Reads operator keystrokes from the debug-console Unix socket and injects
//! them into the guest virtio-console RX queue, then raises `INT_VRING` and
//! force-exits WFI-idle vCPUs so a guest shell sees the input promptly — the
//! same delivery scheme the vsock/net RX workers use.
//!
//! Output flows the other way for free: the console device mirrors guest TX
//! bytes to the same socket from `process_queue`, so an operator attached with
//! `socat - UNIX-CONNECT:<sock>` gets a bidirectional console.
//!
//! This is a debug aid gated behind `VmmConfig::debug_console_socket`; it is
//! not part of the normal boot path. Polling (rather than `kevent`) keeps it
//! dead simple — console I/O is human-paced, so a 10 ms tick is imperceptible.
