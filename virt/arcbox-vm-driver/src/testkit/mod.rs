//! Fakes and the contract test-kit (feature `testkit`).
//!
//! - [`FakeDriver`] — an in-memory [`VmDriver`](crate::VmDriver) with a
//!   real state machine, events, every capability, and scripted failures.
//!   Runtime unit tests drive their real actors and state machines against
//!   it on any host, no KVM required.
//!
//! - [`FakeNetwork`] — an in-memory [`GuestNetwork`](crate::net::GuestNetwork)
//!   handing out `10.200.0.0/16` leases with a quarantine ledger and the
//!   [`NetworkReconcile`](crate::net::NetworkReconcile) token protocol.
//!
//! - [`contract`] — the checks every adapter must pass, packaged as the
//!   [`driver_contract!`](crate::driver_contract) macro over a
//!   [`ContractHarness`]; the fake passes them too (`tests/fake_contract.rs`).
