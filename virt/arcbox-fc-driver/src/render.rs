//! From the port's specs to what Firecracker is told.
//!
//! Two pure decisions live here and nowhere else: which API payloads a
//! [`VmSpec`] / [`RestoreSpec`] becomes, and which path Firecracker sees for
//! every host file. Without a jail, paths pass through verbatim. Under the
//! jailer, Firecracker is chrooted into
//! `{chroot_base}/{firecracker binary name}/{id}/root` and every path it
//! is told is chroot-relative: a host path already under the jail is passed
//! as `/` + its relative part; anything else is staged in first — the
//! kernel to `/vmlinux`, a disk `id` to `/{id}.ext4`, a checkpoint to
//! `/snapshots/{image dir name}/{vmstate,mem}` — and named by where it
//! landed. [`VmLayout`] is that map; [`fc_config`] and [`fc_restore`] use it
//! to produce plans, and [`jail::apply`] executes the staging half.
