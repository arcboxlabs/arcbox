//! Rebuilding a handle over the Firecracker [`discover`](crate::discover)
//! found.
//!
//! The process is the VM's identity and all a kill needs; the API is what
//! everything else needs. So the guard goes over the verified pid first,
//! and the API is reconnected best-effort within a short bound: a VMM
//! that answers `GET /` and `GET /vm/config` gets the full [`FcHandle`] —
//! its devices and paused state read back — and one whose socket is
//! missing, wedged, or closes gets an [`FcProcessHandle`], kill-able and
//! observable and nothing more. An adopt never fails on the API: the
//! sandbox manager's restart sweep adopts in order to `shutdown(Kill)`,
//! and an orphan whose control socket died with its booter would otherwise
//! be unkillable through the port — the blind SIGKILL by pid this replaced
//! had no such dependency.
