//! [`TapNetwork`] as the port's [`GuestNetwork`] and [`NetworkReconcile`].
//!
//! Nothing here is new behavior: every method is one of the inherent
//! operations spoken in the port's vocabulary. The mapping, in one place:
//!
//! | port | inherent |
//! |------|----------|
//! | `reserve(vm, policy)` | `reserve(vm)`; the [`NetworkAllocation`] becomes a [`NetworkLease`] |
//! | `activate(lease, mode)` | `activate(alloc, mode)`; returns the TAP as a [`NicSpec`] named `eth0` |
//! | `adopt(lease, mode)` | `adopt(vm, alloc, mode)`; the guest is already running |
//! | `quarantine(lease)` | `quarantine_checked(vm, alloc)` |
//! | `release(lease)` | `release_checked(alloc)` |
//! | `identity(lease, mode)` | the invariant identity, or the pool identity under `LegacySnapshot` |
//! | `host_ingress(lease)` | `expose_target(tap)`, with the pool IP's fwmark |
//! | `reconcile()` | `Some(self)` while a quarantine ledger is kept |
//! | `NetworkReconcile::*` | the `*_quarantine` / `*_startup_cleanup` methods |
//! | `replay_complete()` | `mark_reconciled()` |
//!
//! A [`NetworkLease`] carries what the port needs — VM, address, prefix,
//! gateway, MAC, cleanup token — and the allocation is rebuilt from it:
//! the TAP name is a function of the address, the resolver list is the
//! network's own. [`NetworkPolicy`]'s `Isolated` and `Nat` are the same TAP
//! shape here (egress policy is the composer's netfilter business, not the
//! link's); `Bridged` is refused at `reserve`, since a bridged attachment is
//! not something a TAP network offers.
