//! TCP shim: hand-rolled handshake synthesizer + fast-path data plane.
//!
//! Replaces the smoltcp-based implementation entirely. The shim does the
//! minimum translation work a frame-to-socket bridge needs: generate our
//! own ISN, synthesize SYN-ACK / SYN / ACK frames for the 3-way, then
//! promote the connection to `FastPathConn` where host-socket bytes are
//! forwarded to/from the guest via TCP frames (or zero-copy inline via
//! the `arcbox-net-inject` thread when available).
//!
//! No congestion control, retransmission, reordering, or TIME_WAIT state
//! is implemented here — both endpoints (guest Linux kernel, host macOS
//! kernel) own their own TCP stacks end-to-end; any state machine work in
//! the middle would be duplication.
