//! Live registry of the job-execution backends behind the agent's
//! advertised capabilities.
//!
//! One shared handle replaces the per-consumer `Option<DockerRunner>` /
//! `Option<VmRunner>` / `Option<InteropRunner>` copies that used to be
//! frozen at startup: offer routing (`RunnerSupervisor`), capability
//! advertisement (`attach`), image preparation (`FleetImageService`), and
//! `GetAgentInfo` all read the same slots, so what the agent advertises
//! and what it can actually serve cannot drift apart.
//!
//! On the wire, the capability set is per-attachment declarative state:
//! the gateway rewrites the machine's capability pools from each `Attach`
//! handshake, and a reconnect refreshes them. This registry is the client
//! half of that contract — the VM slot can activate after startup (an
//! arcbox-daemon that was not up yet when the agent started at login),
//! and the attach loop re-attaches with the fresh set when it does.
//!
//! Activation is one-way: a slot never empties once filled, so
//! "capability advertised ⇒ runner present" holds for the process
//! lifetime. A backend that dies later surfaces as per-job failures
//! (reject + platform re-offer), never as a capability retraction.
