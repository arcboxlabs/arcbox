//! ArcBox Fleet runner agent.
//!
//! A standalone binary, for macOS and Linux hosts, that enrolls with the
//! Fleet gateway and, once attached, runs GitHub Actions jobs. Linux jobs
//! run in a Docker container for isolation when a Docker-compatible runtime
//! is available; other jobs run via the pre-installed runner
//! (`run.sh --jitconfig …`).
//!
//! Configuration is environment-driven (`ARCBOX_FLEET_*`). The `enroll` and
//! `quick enroll` subcommands read the fleet join token from a file
//! (`--token-file`) or stdin by default; `--token` is accepted for convenience
//! but discouraged, as it leaks the token through the process argument list
//! and shell history.
//!
//! Two ways to run: `quick run` requires a credential from a prior
//! `quick enroll` (the socketless headless/farm path) and does nothing else.
//! `serve` additionally exposes the local control-plane API on `agent.sock`,
//! and does not require a credential up front — `enroll`/`drain`/`resume`/
//! `unenroll`/`restart` can drive it from another invocation of this CLI, or
//! from the desktop app, while it runs.

// The local control-plane API (agent.sock) is a Unix domain socket with no
// Windows equivalent implemented, so this crate targets macOS and Linux
// only. A single, clear message here beats a scattered trail of
// "type not found" errors across `control/`.
