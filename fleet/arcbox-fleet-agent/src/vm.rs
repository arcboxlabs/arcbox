//! macOS VM-based execution of darwin runner jobs.
//!
//! Each accepted darwin job boots a disposable macOS guest through the local
//! `arcbox-daemon` (its `MacosService` gRPC on the daemon socket), then runs
//! the Actions runner **baked into the base image** over SSH:
//!
//! 1. copy-on-write clone + boot (`Create`/`Start` — the daemon enforces the
//!    two-guests-per-host Apple license cap, so a `Start` failure is an
//!    admission signal, not a fault),
//! 2. resolve the guest address (`Inspect` reports its DHCP lease),
//! 3. `ssh admin@guest run.sh --jitconfig …` — the session's exit is the
//!    job's completion,
//! 4. `Remove(force)` — destroying the guest is teardown *and* cancellation;
//!    there is no in-guest process management.
//!
//! The guest contract is the ArcBox macOS runner image
//! (`macos-runner-image-builder`): runner preinstalled at
//! [`GUEST_RUNNER_SCRIPT`], SSH login `admin`/`admin` — a deliberate,
//! documented choice for disposable CI guests, which are reachable only from
//! their own host over vmnet NAT. Password auth is why SSH goes through
//! `russh` rather than the OpenSSH binary (which cannot take a password
//! non-interactively).
