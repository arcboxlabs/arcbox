//! Runner supervision: the agent is the admission authority. On each offer it
//! decides — against live host state — whether to run the job, starts the
//! runner, and answers the gateway with **accept** (the runner started) or
//! **reject** (try another host). It reports no authoritative outcome — the
//! GitHub webhook concludes the job — but a started runner's exit does emit
//! a `RunnerExited` liveness hint so the platform can fail fast when no
//! webhook is ever coming (the runner died before completing anything).
//!
//! Backend is chosen from the agent's own advertised capabilities: Linux jobs a
//! Docker capability serves run in a container (isolation); darwin jobs a `vm`
//! capability serves run in a disposable macOS guest via the local daemon
//! (isolation); a `host_runner` capability runs via the pre-installed runner —
//! directly for the native platform, or across the WSL interop boundary for a
//! windows capability served from inside WSL2.
//! Capacity is never a number — admission gates on live load and free memory,
//! so a busy host simply rejects and the platform re-offers elsewhere.
