//! The layer rules and the grandfathered edges, as data.
//!
//! This table is the one place the layer rules are written down for the
//! machine; the AGENTS.md files that state them in prose point here. To add a
//! rule, append a [`Rule`] whose `reason` names the document that owns it —
//! a rule may name a crate that does not exist yet, it is a no-op until the
//! crate lands. To grandfather an edge, append an [`Exception`] with the
//! reason the edge exists and the phase (`until`) that removes it; the gate
//! fails once that edge is gone, so the exception leaves with it.
