//! A manager over the fakes, and the waits its flows need.
//!
//! Every port this crate has is faked here — the VM driver
//! (`arcbox_vm_driver::testkit::FakeDriver`), the guest network
//! (`FakeNetwork`), the guest agent
//! ([`FakeAgentFactory`](arcbox_computer_runtime::testkit::agent::FakeAgentFactory))
//! and the copy-on-write rootfs (`CowTestProbe`) — so the real create →
//! boot → gate → ready → exec → pause → resume → checkpoint → restore →
//! expire → remove paths run on any host with no KVM, no root and no
//! Firecracker.
//!
//! What is *not* faked is the manager: these tests reach it only through
//! its public API, so nothing here can put a computer in a state a real
//! flow does not produce.
