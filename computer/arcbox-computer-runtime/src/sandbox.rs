//! `SandboxManager` — orchestrates sandbox microVM lifecycle.
//!
//! A sandbox is a short-lived, strongly-isolated microVM decoupled from its
//! workload: when the initial `cmd` process exits the sandbox transitions back
//! to `Ready` rather than stopping, and continues accepting `Run` calls until
//! an explicit `Stop`/`Remove` or TTL expiry.
//!
//! `create_sandbox` returns immediately with state `"starting"`.  The VM boots
//! in a background task which broadcasts a `"ready"` event on success.
