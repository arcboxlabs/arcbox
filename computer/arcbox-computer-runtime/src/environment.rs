//! Environment-specific components a composer supplies to the sandbox stack.
//!
//! The manager runs in more than one environment — the ArcBox System VM
//! with its known busybox userland, or a stock distro on a bare-metal
//! node — and every part that differs is supplied here rather than built
//! in the code. There is no default and no member is optional:
//! [`ComputerManager::new`](crate::ComputerManager::new) builds none of the
//! four, so what VMM its Computers run on is the composer's decision and
//! never a fallback taken here (vm-stack-redesign R3, charter D4).
//!
//! The System VM's composition is `arcbox_agent::sandbox::node_environment`
//! — the Firecracker driver from the config's `[firecracker]` section, the
//! TAP network from its `[network]` section, the `arcbox-vm-proto` agent
//! client, and a copy-on-write rootfs manager over busybox.
