//! Pause / Resume — checkpoint a sandbox and release its VM while keeping
//! the record, checkpoint, and disk overlay under the same id (CORE-21).
//!
//! Pause differs from Checkpoint+Stop in two load-bearing ways:
//!
//! - The VM is **not resumed** after the snapshot. Any guest progress after
//!   the memory image is written would diverge from the retained disk, so
//!   the snapshot is the sandbox's final state until Resume.
//! - The disk survives. The dm-snapshot overlay is detached but its
//!   persistent (`P`) COW file stays on disk (or, in copy-mode fallback,
//!   the staged rootfs copy is moved out of the chroot), and Resume
//!   re-assembles exactly the device the memory image expects. A plain
//!   Restore instead builds a fresh overlay from the template, discarding
//!   writes — which is why restoring *from* a pause checkpoint is refused.
//!
//! Resume mirrors the fresh-network restore path: a new TAP + IP is
//! allocated (`RestoreSandboxSpec::network_override` semantics) and the
//! sandbox returns to `Ready` under its original id. The old allocation was
//! quarantined at pause time and its host forwarding state cleaned via the
//! same durable ticket flow Stop uses. Whether the guest needs re-addressing
//! at all depends on the snapshot's addressing mode — an invariant-addressed
//! guest (CORE-81) already holds the fixed link-local identity and only the
//! host-side TAP changes.
//!
//! A sandbox that adopted a pre-warmed restore slot (CORE-78) lives in the
//! slot's chroot with slot-keyed dm/CoW names. Pause releases that chroot and
//! renames the retained overlay onto the sandbox-id path, so from `Paused`
//! onwards every resource is keyed by the sandbox id again and resume,
//! reconciliation, and `Remove` all see one naming scheme.
