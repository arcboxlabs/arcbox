//! Crash-recovery reconciliation for sandbox runtime state.
//!
//! `SandboxManager` state is in-memory; if the agent restarts (crash,
//! supervision respawn) the VMM processes, TAP devices, dm-snapshot
//! devices, and jailer chroots of running sandboxes are left with no owner,
//! and fresh IP allocations can collide with orphaned TAPs. To recover,
//! every successful boot/restore persists a small `state.json` next to the
//! sandbox's runtime files, and a new manager sweeps those records.
//!
//! A sandbox whose VM is *still running* is reclaimed rather than
//! destroyed, so a crash or an upgrade of the composing process does not
//! cost every guest on the node its work (CORE-135). One journal is adopted
//! when all of these hold, and killed the moment any of them does not —
//! every refusal falls back to the teardown this sweep did before adoption
//! existed, because re-establishing the wrong host state is worse than
//! starting over:
//!
//! - the driver's `Adopt` capability found and reconnected to the VMM;
//! - that handle reports [`VmState::Running`] — a quiesced guest is a
//!   checkpoint that died between the pause and the resume;
//! - the handle has vsock, which is what separates a full one from the
//!   process-only fallback an orphan with a dead API yields: without it
//!   nothing can be run, paused or checkpointed in the sandbox, only killed;
//! - the durable record is `Ready`. `Starting` died with the boot task that
//!   was driving it and nothing here finishes one; the transitional phases
//!   died between resource states;
//! - the journal says how its lease attaches ([`SandboxStateRecord::attach_mode`]),
//!   and the guest network takes that lease back under exactly that mode;
//! - the CoW manager re-registers the dm-snapshot the guest is running on.
//!
//! Everything else is torn down as before, and then durable lifecycle
//! records are normalized for replay and inspection.
//!
//! What a reclaim does *not* restore is the host's half: the composing host
//! clears every sandbox's DNS record and port listeners on the startup
//! handshake ([`SandboxHost::clear_host_state`]'s premise was that a
//! restarting agent left nothing alive), so an adopted sandbox keeps
//! running and stays reachable over vsock and at its address, but loses its
//! name and its published ports until something re-registers them. Nothing
//! leaks — the guest-side forwarding rules survive and a later Remove still
//! sweeps them — and the fix belongs to the host half, not here.
