//! The checkpoint sub-task: freezing a computer's guest and committing the
//! image to the catalog.
//!
//! Moved here from `sandbox::checkpoint` by R3 PR-F1d, unchanged: this is the
//! body `Effect::SpawnCheckpoint` names, and that effect's `hold` is this
//! request's `resume_after`, inverted. Its three callers — the Checkpoint
//! RPC, the warm publish, and pause — still drive it directly until R3 PR-F2
//! flips the manager onto the actor.
//!
//! A failure says whether the guest is still usable, and every caller must
//! act on that: `Frozen` means the port has no verb left to thaw it, so the
//! computer fails rather than reporting `Ready` for a guest that answers
//! nothing.
