//! The restore flow's sub-task: bringing a checkpointed computer back up.
//!
//! Moved here from `sandbox::checkpoint` by R3 PR-F1c, unchanged: this is the
//! body `Effect::SpawnRestore` names — claim a pre-warmed slot or prepare and
//! stage a fresh one, load the image, re-address the guest, journal what it
//! now owns. Everything around it stays with the manager: the durable intent,
//! the id reservation, the atomic `ReadyWithOutcome` commit, and the rollback
//! that unwinds a failure. `sandbox::checkpoint::restore_from_snapshot` is
//! still the caller until R3 PR-F2 flips the manager onto the actor.
//!
//! Two orderings inside are load-bearing and commented at their sites: the
//! clock sync stays **detached** (awaiting it measured +57 ms on the restore
//! hot path, CORE-80), and the claimed slot's journal is cleared only *after*
//! the adopting computer's own journal is durable — the other order leaves a
//! crash window with no journal at all, and the slot-keyed VMM, chroot and
//! CoW invisible to reconciliation.
