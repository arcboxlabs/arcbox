//! The pause release: freeing a checkpointed computer's runtime while its
//! disk survives.
//!
//! Moved here from `sandbox::pause` by R3 PR-F1d, unchanged: this is the body
//! `Effect::SpawnRelease { KeepDisk }` names. `sandbox::pause` still drives
//! it until R3 PR-F2 flips the manager onto the actor.
//!
//! The ordering mirrors a full release and is load-bearing for the same
//! reasons: the VMM must be dead before the dm detach (EBUSY) and before the
//! TAP goes. What differs is the disk — the overlay is detached with its COW
//! file kept, or, in copy mode, the staged rootfs is taken back out of the
//! VM's area and parked in `vm_dir` — and the renaming that leaves every
//! retained resource keyed by the computer's own id.
//!
//! **The copy-mode disk comes out of the VM's area before the VMM is
//! killed.** In copy mode the staged rootfs *is* the paused computer's
//! disk, and it lives wherever the driver put it — an area a kill is
//! entitled to take with it, and one nothing here can name. So the disk is
//! taken back out through the port first, while a grip on that area is
//! still held; only then is the VMM discarded. The other order reports a
//! successful pause and leaves the resume that follows with no disk, which
//! is why it is stated here rather than left to the reader of two
//! statements twenty lines apart.
//!
//! The guest is quiesced by the checkpoint that precedes this, which is
//! what makes taking its disk out safe while its VMM is still up.
