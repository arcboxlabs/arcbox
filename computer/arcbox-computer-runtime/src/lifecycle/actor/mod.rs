//! The per-computer lifecycle actor: sole owner of one computer's state
//! machine, and the only thing that executes its effects.
//!
//! One actor task per computer. Manager verbs arrive as [`Command`]s on an
//! `mpsc`; the slow flows run in sub-tasks ([`ComputerTasks`]) whose
//! epoch-tagged completions come back on a second channel; the public state
//! is published on a `watch` no reader has to wait for. Same shape, and
//! deliberately the same idiom, as `arcbox-engine`'s `vm_lifecycle::actor`.
//!
//! Three properties are why it exists at all:
//!
//! - **A force-remove preempts an in-flight boot.** The mailbox replaces the
//!   per-computer cleanup lock, which had no preemption: a Remove issued
//!   during a capture waited for the capture. The slow work lives in
//!   sub-tasks precisely so [`Effect::AbortInflight`] can cancel one —
//!   bounded by the boot's own resource handoff (see [`Self::abort_inflight`]).
//! - **The data plane never round-trips the mailbox.** The guest agent rides
//!   the [`ComputerSnapshot`], so exec and the file verbs read it lock-free
//!   and call the guest directly. An actor hop per exec would be a latency
//!   regression measured against the cold-start baselines.
//! - **The timers are the actor's own.** A per-computer actor *is* the
//!   generation, so the epoch-stamped timer slots and `Weak` staleness checks
//!   a detached expiry task needed collapse into two `Sleep`s in the select
//!   loop.
//!
//! What the machine deliberately does not carry, the actor does: an event's
//! attributes (the PAUSING reason, the FAILED error, the IDLE exit code), the
//! parked replies, and the failure text a durable `Failed` write records.
//!
//! Nothing constructs one yet: R3 PR-F1 lands the actor and moves the flow
//! bodies onto [`ComputerTasks`] one file at a time; PR-F2 flips the manager
//! onto it and implements the port.
