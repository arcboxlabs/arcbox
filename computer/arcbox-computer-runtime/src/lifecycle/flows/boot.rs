//! The cold-boot flows: bringing the VM up, and the readiness gate READY is
//! withheld for.
//!
//! `boot_sandbox`'s two halves, split where the machine splits them. What was
//! the tail's own bookkeeping — the generation re-checks, the `Ready` /
//! `Starting` assignment, the durable `Ready` write, the READY event and the
//! failure handling — belongs to the actor now; what is left is the work.
