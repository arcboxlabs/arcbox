//! The flows one computer's actor spawns: the [`ComputerTasks`]
//! implementation over the real driver, network, record store and catalogs.
//!
//! The bodies themselves live in [`super::tasks`] — PR-F1 moved them there
//! one file at a time. What is here is the wiring the actor cannot have: the
//! services every computer shares, the one-shot inputs a launch consumes, and
//! the handle back to the mailbox that the readiness gate's initial `cmd`
//! claims its workload slot through.
//!
//! That handle is deliberately **weak**. A gate holding a live sender would
//! keep its own actor's mailbox open forever, and the actor stops when its
//! last sender drops — which is how a reservation that was never committed
//! shuts one down.
