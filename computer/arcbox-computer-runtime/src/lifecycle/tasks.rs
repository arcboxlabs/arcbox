//! The slow work a lifecycle transition asks for: one verb per `Spawn*`
//! effect, run in a sub-task the actor owns.
//!
//! The machine decides *that* a flow should run and the actor sequences it;
//! this port runs it. Keeping the two apart is what makes the actor's
//! sequencing — preemption, epochs, the boot's resource handoff, the parked
//! replies — testable with no VMM, no driver and no record store, and it is
//! the seam R3 PR-F1 moves the flow bodies onto one file at a time while the
//! manager still drives them.
//!
//! Every verb reports back exactly once. A failure says which *class* it is,
//! because that is what the machine branches on: a recoverable one leaves the
//! computer where it was ([`TaskFailure::recoverable`]), a frozen guest cannot
//! go back to `Ready` ([`TaskFailure::frozen`]).
