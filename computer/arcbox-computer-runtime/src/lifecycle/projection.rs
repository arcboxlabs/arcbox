//! The two questions asked about a lifecycle state: what a caller sees, and
//! what a crash-restart reads back.
//!
//! They are deliberately different. `running` is the workload hot path and
//! writes no record, so it is durably `Ready`; `gating` and `removing` have no
//! `SandboxState` of their own.
