//! Shared daemon state threaded through all lifecycle phases.
//!
//! The startup sequence produces progressively richer context types:
//!
//! ```text
//! Startup::prepare_host()          → EarlyContext   (no lock, no runtime)
//! Startup::acquire_daemon_lease()  → DaemonContext  (lock held, no runtime yet)
//! Startup::boot_runtime()          → Arc<Runtime>   (also fills SharedRuntime for gRPC)
//! ```
//!
//! This encoding makes it a compile error to access the daemon lock
//! before it has been acquired, or to skip the lock phase entirely.
