//! Shared daemon state threaded through all lifecycle phases.
//!
//! The startup sequence produces progressively richer context types:
//!
//! ```text
//! init_early()   → EarlyContext      (no lock, no runtime)
//! acquire_lock() → DaemonContext     (lock held, no runtime yet)
//! init_runtime() → Arc<Runtime>      (also fills SharedRuntime for gRPC)
//! ```
//!
//! This encoding makes it a compile error to access the daemon lock
//! before it has been acquired, or to skip the lock phase entirely.
