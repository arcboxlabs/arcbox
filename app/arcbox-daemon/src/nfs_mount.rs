//! Host-side NFSv4 mount of the guest docker data export at `~/ArcBox`.
//!
//! The guest agent exports `/var/lib/docker` read-only over NFSv4, which serves
//! everything on the single well-known port 2049 (no MOUNT protocol). This
//! module runs one localhost TCP proxy and bridges it to the guest over vsock:
//!
//! ```text
//! mount_nfs -o vers=4,port=<nfsd> 127.0.0.1:/ ~/ArcBox
//!   └─ 127.0.0.1:<nfsd> → vsock NFS_NFSD_RELAY_PORT (HalfCloseStream-framed) → guest 127.0.0.1:2049
//! ```
//!
//! Readiness needs no separate probe: the reconcile simply retries `mount_nfs`
//! until the guest server answers, so the mount is its own liveness check and
//! the path works identically on the HV and VZ backends.
