//! Smoke suite — the "does the product basically work" checks (ABX-291).
//!
//! These are the assertions a release should never ship without: a container
//! runs and the CLI returns, a published port reaches it from the host, and a
//! container resolves a sibling by name. Everything else in `tests/e2e`
//! targets a specific defect class; this file targets the happy path itself,
//! which until now had no automated coverage at all.
//!
//! **One VM, sequential phases.** Each phase costs a full System VM boot if
//! split across `#[test]` functions, so this follows `boot_assets`: one boot,
//! phases named for the issue they close, recorded into `metrics.json`. A
//! failing phase masks later ones — acceptable here, since a broken
//! `docker run` makes the rest meaningless anyway.
//!
//! **Isolation.** No fixed host ports: the published-port phase asks Docker
//! for an ephemeral one on `127.0.0.1` and reads it back with `docker port`,
//! per the parallel-safety contract in AGENTS.md.
//!
//! Covers ABX-305 (run & exit), #268 (stdin EOF reaches the container),
//! ABX-306 (published port), ABX-308 (name resolution), ABX-309 (boot
//! budget), CORE-67 (setup phase progression).
//!
//! Deliberately **not** covered: **ABX-307** (L3 direct routing to a
//! container IP via bridge100). The host route is installed by the
//! privileged helper (`route_add` in `app/arcbox-helper`), which the harness
//! does not run and AGENTS.md forbids touching. A test here would silently
//! depend on the developer's installed ArcBox having placed the route — host
//! state, not product behavior. It needs a helper-aware harness first.
