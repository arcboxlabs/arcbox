# ArcBox E2E tests

This crate contains end-to-end tests that orchestrate ArcBox binaries, VM boot
assets, Docker, and external test fixtures. Keep long-running test process
management here rather than in `xtask`.

E2E tests use Rust's standard test harness instead of a custom runner. Tests are
ignored by default because they build release binaries, boot a VM, and require
macOS virtualization support (plus a local Docker CLI for the daemon-level test).

## Fixtures

- `signing::ensure_signed` — idempotently signs a test binary with the
  virtualization entitlements: Developer ID when the ArcBox identity is in the
  keychain, otherwise ad-hoc with `bundle/arcbox.dev.entitlements` (sufficient
  for HV/VZ; only bridged vmnet needs Developer ID).
- `daemon::DaemonHandle` — spawns a signed `arcbox-daemon` under an isolated
  `--data-dir` and waits for readiness on the daemon's `WatchSetupStatus` gRPC
  stream, failing fast on a FAILED phase or daemon exit (with the log tail).
  Drop terminates the daemon gracefully (SIGTERM, then SIGKILL). The isolated
  data dir means tests never touch `~/.arcbox` and can run alongside a
  developer's daemon.
- `DaemonHandle::dump_virtio_debug` — fetches the daemon's `GetVirtioDebug`
  snapshot (per-queue kicks, interrupts, live avail/used ring indices;
  HV backend only) into `virtio-debug.json` under the data dir. The
  boot-assets scenario and the `hv_e2e` probe capture it automatically on
  failure, while the VM is still alive.

## Parallel daemon control planes: one data dir per daemon

Persistent state — flock, gRPC/Docker sockets, logs, and machines — derives
from `--data-dir` (`HostLayout`). The harness also requests kernel-assigned
DNS and Kubernetes ports, so daemon control planes with distinct data dirs run
side by side. That is the isolation contract for parallel fix work:
**one worktree/agent = one data dir**, and the harness enforces it —
`DaemonHandle::spawn` refuses a data dir inside `~/.arcbox` or `~/.arcbox-dev`.

The container CIDR and host route are not isolated by the harness. Never run
multiple VM-booting harness daemons, or one beside a live ArcBox daemon.

Three host-global resources are *not* covered by the data dir. Tests must not
touch them:

- **Privileged helper state** (`/var/run/arcbox*`, `/etc/resolver`, host
  routes) — never run the helper from a test.
- **Docker CLI context** (`~/.docker`) — never pass `--docker-integration`;
  point the Docker CLI at the handle's socket with `DOCKER_HOST` instead.
- **Published host ports** — don't publish fixed host ports from containers;
  concurrent runs would collide.

## Commands

Daemon-level test — boots the VM through a real daemon and runs Docker
lifecycle checks over the Docker API socket:

```bash
cargo test -p arcbox-e2e --test boot_assets -- --ignored --nocapture
```

VMM-level HV probe — drives the HV backend directly (no daemon): boot, vsock
agent RPC, DAX, agent supervision, pause/resume, stop:

```bash
cargo test -p arcbox-e2e --test hv_vmm -- --ignored --nocapture
```

Idle-balloon regression (2026-07-15 incident) — boots a VZ daemon with a
short idle timeout, holds a memory workload, lets the VM idle-shrink, then
grows the workload inside the guest and requires the guest-driven pressure
restore (no reclaim storm, Docker responsive):

```bash
cargo test -p arcbox-e2e --test idle_balloon -- --ignored --nocapture
```

Machine stats stream — boots a VZ daemon, subscribes to
`StatsService.Watch`, and asserts sane progressing samples plus the
StatsHub lifecycle (concurrent subscribers share one guest stream; the
pump stops when the last one leaves):

```bash
cargo test -p arcbox-e2e --test stats_watch -- --ignored --nocapture
```

Kubernetes LoadBalancer forwarding — boots a VZ daemon, starts k3s, and
follows a LoadBalancer Service's port on the host: it answers and is reported
forwarded, moves with the Service, closes when the Service is deleted, and is
gone when a Kubernetes stop returns. k3s pulls klipper-lb and the workload
image (`ARCBOX_E2E_IMAGE`) itself, so the guest needs registry access:

```bash
cargo test -p arcbox-e2e --test kubernetes_lb -- --ignored --nocapture
```

Dual-backend matrix — the boot-assets scenario once per backend, VZ first.
VZ is the oracle: HV-only red means an HV implementation bug, double red means
the bug is above the hypervisor layer:

```bash
cargo test -p arcbox-e2e --test backend_matrix -- --ignored --nocapture
```

Stress runner — repeated runs with artifact capture (per-run logs under
`target/e2e-artifacts/<unix-time>/`, failing runs' preserved data dirs
recorded in the summary). Race fixes need a cheap red first:

```bash
cargo xtask e2e --backend both --repeat 20
cargo xtask e2e --test hv_vmm --backend hv --repeat 200 --fail-fast
```

When using the repository development shell, prefix with `devenv shell --`.

List available E2E tests without running ignored tests:

```bash
cargo test -p arcbox-e2e -- --list
```

## Configuration

Environment variables read by the tests:

- `SKIP_BUILD=1` — reuse existing `target/release` binaries.
- `KEEP_TEST_DIR=1` — always preserve the temporary test directory (it is
  preserved automatically when the test fails).
- `ARCBOX_BOOT_ASSET_VERSION=<version>` — override `assets.lock`
  `[boot].version`.
- `ARCBOX_VM_BACKEND=vz|hv` — System VM backend for the daemon under test
  (first-boot default; the daemon reads the same variable). The matrix test
  overrides it per run. To pin the guest vCPU count at this level, set
  `ARCBOX_VM_CPUS=N` in the environment (default: host core count) — the
  spawned daemon inherits it via the config env layer. The isolated data
  dir's `config.toml` is NOT read (`Config::load_for_profile` merges only
  the user/system config files plus `ARCBOX_*` env), and editing the user
  config would leak state across parallel runs. The `ARCBOX_HV_E2E_VCPUS`
  knob only drives the bare `hv_e2e` probe, not daemon-level tests.
- `ARCBOX_E2E_IMAGE=<ref>` — container image for the lifecycle tests
  (default `alpine:latest`). Point it at a mirror on networks where the
  guest cannot reach docker.io.
- `ARCBOX_GUEST_DOCKER_VSOCK_PORT=<port>` — pass a custom guest Docker vsock
  port to `arcbox-daemon`.
- `ARCBOX_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECS=<secs>` — shorten the daemon's VM idle timeout
  (default 300); the idle-balloon test sets it to 20.
- `ARCBOX_HV_E2E_KERNEL` / `ARCBOX_HV_E2E_ROOTFS` / `ARCBOX_HV_E2E_TIMEOUT` /
  `ARCBOX_DATA_DIR` — HV probe overrides; see `src/bin/hv_e2e.rs`.
- `ARCBOX_E2E_METRICS_DIR` / `ARCBOX_E2E_RUN_LABEL` — archive per-run phase
  timings as `<label>.metrics.json` in the given directory (set automatically
  by `cargo xtask e2e`). Runs also write `metrics.json` into their data dir.
- `ARCBOX_E2E_IPERF_IMAGE=<ref>` — guest iperf3 image for the
  `network_iperf` throughput matrix (default `networkstatic/iperf3:latest`).
- `ARCBOX_E2E_IPERF_MIN_GBPS=<f64>` — `network_iperf` gate floor. Unset (or
  0) gates on liveness only (VZ throughput is too run-to-run variable for an
  automated target); set it on a quiet machine to enforce a real per-host
  throughput floor. A present-but-invalid value fails the test rather than
  silently disabling the gate.

Tracing is controlled with `RUST_LOG`; it defaults to `info` when unset.
