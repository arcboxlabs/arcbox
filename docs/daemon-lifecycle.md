# Daemon Lifecycle

## Startup Sequence

The daemon starts in five ordered phases. Each phase must complete before
the next begins.

```
init_early        Create directories, resolve config          ~instant
    │
acquire_lock      flock(daemon.lock), terminate stale daemon  ~instant or ≤30 s
    │
start_grpc        Bind arcbox.sock, SystemService available   ~instant
    │             Desktop can connect from this point on.
    │
wait_for_resources  Wait for docker.img holders to release    0–10 s
    │               Reported as CLEANING_UP phase via gRPC.
    │
init_runtime      Seed/download boot assets, start VM         variable
                  Reported as DOWNLOADING_ASSETS → ASSETS_READY
                  → VM_STARTING → VM_READY → NETWORK_READY.
    │
start_services    DNS, Docker API, Docker CLI integration     ~instant
    │
Ready             SetupPhase::Ready
```

### Why gRPC starts before resource cleanup

The desktop app polls the daemon's gRPC `WatchSetupStatus` stream with a
30 s timeout. If gRPC were started after stale-daemon cleanup (which can
block for up to 40 s), the desktop would time out. Moving gRPC earlier
lets clients observe the full phase progression in real time.

## Daemon Lock (`daemon.lock`)

Exclusive ownership is managed by a POSIX advisory lock (`flock(2)`) on
`~/.arcbox/run/daemon.lock`. The lock file also stores the current PID
for diagnostics.

### Properties

- **Kernel-managed**: released automatically on process exit, crash, or
  SIGKILL. No stale-lock scenarios are possible.
- **Reentrant-safe**: the file is never deleted. New daemons reuse it.
- **Non-blocking probe**: `flock(LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB)` tests whether
  another daemon is alive without polling.

### Acquisition flow

```
open(daemon.lock, O_CREAT | O_RDWR)
    │
flock(LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB)
    ├─ success → no stale daemon, proceed
    └─ EWOULDBLOCK → lock held
        │
        read PID from file
        │
        is_arcbox_daemon(pid)?
        ├─ yes → SIGTERM, wait up to 30 s, SIGKILL fallback
        └─ no  → log warning, wait for lock release
        │
        flock(LOCK_EX)   ← blocks until holder exits
        │
write current PID
```

## Graceful Shutdown (SIGTERM / Ctrl+C)

```
signal received
  ├─ cancel CancellationToken         → all services begin draining
  ├─ drain(DNS, Docker, gRPC)         → 5 s timeout, then abort
  ├─ remove_route()                   → clean up container subnet route (macOS)
  ├─ runtime.shutdown()
  │   ├─ stop port forwarders
  │   ├─ vm_lifecycle.shutdown()       → graceful VM stop, flush disk
  │   ├─ stop remaining machines
  │   └─ network_manager.stop()
  ├─ DockerContextManager.disable()   → remove Docker CLI integration
  ├─ cleanup_files()                  → delete docker.sock, arcbox.sock
  │                                     daemon.lock kept (flock auto-releases)
  └─ process exits
```

### Residual state after graceful exit

| File | State | Next startup |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `daemon.lock` | exists, old PID, **lock released** | `try_flock` succeeds instantly |
| `docker.sock` | deleted | — |
| `arcbox.sock` | deleted | — |
| `docker.img` | exists, no holders | — |
| VM | gracefully stopped | — |

No manual intervention needed.

## Crash / SIGKILL

When the daemon is killed without graceful shutdown:

- `flock` is released by the kernel (fd closed).
- Socket files are **not** cleaned up.
- VM is **not** gracefully stopped.
- Container subnet route is **not** removed.
- `docker.img` may still be held by Virtualization.framework XPC helpers.

### Residual state after crash

| File | State | Next startup |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `daemon.lock` | exists, old PID, **lock released** | `try_flock` succeeds instantly |
| `docker.sock` | **stale** | `DockerApiServer::run` removes before bind |
| `arcbox.sock` | **stale** | `start_grpc` removes before bind |
| `docker.img` | **possibly held by XPC helpers** | `wait_for_resources` waits up to 10 s |
| VM | non-graceful termination | Virtualization.framework cleans up |
| Route | **stale** | `recovery::run()` rebuilds |

All residual state is handled automatically on next startup. No manual
intervention needed.

## Stale Daemon Takeover

When a new daemon starts while an old one is still running:

1. `acquire_lock` detects the held lock.
2. Reads the old PID from `daemon.lock`.
3. Verifies it is an arcbox-daemon process (`libproc::pidpath`).
4. Sends SIGTERM → old daemon begins graceful shutdown.
5. Waits up to 30 s for the old daemon to exit.
6. Falls back to SIGKILL if unresponsive.
7. Acquires the lock once released.
8. `start_grpc` removes any stale sockets before binding.
9. `wait_for_resources` waits for `docker.img` holders to release.

The old daemon's graceful shutdown runs its full sequence (drain, VM stop,
socket cleanup). The new daemon only needs to handle the `docker.img`
holdover case.

## Socket Lifecycle

Each server owns its socket file. Sockets are **not** cleaned up
centrally during startup — each server removes and rebinds independently:

| Socket | Owner | Cleanup |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `arcbox.sock` | `services::start_grpc` | `remove_file` before `UnixListener::bind` |
| `docker.sock` | `DockerApiServer::run` | `remove_file` before `UnixListener::bind` |

This avoids race conditions where a centralized cleanup could delete a
socket that another component has already bound.

## Edge Cases

### docker.img held by orphaned XPC helpers

Virtualization.framework spawns XPC helper processes that may outlive the
daemon. These processes hold `docker.img` open. The daemon waits up to
10 s for them to exit (`wait_for_resources`), then proceeds. If they
persist, `init_runtime` may fail because the disk image is locked.

**Manual fix**: `ps aux | grep -i virtualization` and kill the orphaned
helpers, then restart the daemon.

The daemon does **not** SIGKILL these processes automatically because
forceful termination risks corrupting the guest filesystem.

### Lock held by non-arcbox process

If `daemon.lock` is held by a process that is not an arcbox-daemon (e.g.,
a debugger or strace wrapper), `acquire_lock` logs a warning and blocks
until the lock is released. It does not send signals to non-arcbox
processes.

### PID reuse

With `flock`, PID reuse is not a concern. The lock is tied to the file
descriptor, not the PID. Even if the kernel reuses a PID for an unrelated
process, the new daemon detects that the lock is not held (because the
original holder's fd was closed on exit) and proceeds immediately.

This is the key advantage over PID-file-based detection, where a reused
PID could cause the daemon to incorrectly signal an unrelated process.
