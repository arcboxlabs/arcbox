# Daemon Lifecycle

## Startup Sequence

Startup is a typed pipeline of eight ordered steps
(`app/arcbox-daemon/src/main.rs::start` → `startup/pipeline.rs`). Each step
consumes the previous step's context type, so skipping or reordering a step
is a compile error.

```
prepare_host             Create directories, resolve config      ~instant
    │
acquire_daemon_lease     flock(daemon.lock), terminate stale     ~instant or ≤30 s
    │                    daemon
    │
start_control_plane      Bind arcbox.sock, SystemService up      ~instant
    │                    Desktop can connect from this point on.
    │
release_stale_resources  Wait for disk-image holders to release  0–10 s
    │                    Reported as CLEANING_UP via gRPC.
    │
prepare_assets           Seed/download boot assets               variable
    │                    Reported as DOWNLOADING_ASSETS →
    │                    ASSETS_READY.
    │
boot_runtime             Construct Runtime, boot the System VM   variable
    │                    Reported as VM_STARTING → VM_READY,
    │                    published from inside Runtime::init so
    │                    the span covers the guest boot alone.
    │
start_runtime_services   DNS, Docker API, critical recovery      ~instant
    │                    Then optional production Docker context;
    │                    reported as NETWORK_READY.
    │
mark_ready               SetupPhase::Ready
```

If any step fails, the daemon publishes `SetupPhase::Failed` with the
error text in `SetupStatus.error`, waits ~200 ms so connected
`WatchSetupStatus` streams flush the final event, and exits non-zero.
Clients should treat FAILED (or stream EOF plus daemon exit) as
startup failure.

### Phase enum caveats

- The observable progression is `INITIALIZING → [CLEANING_UP →
  INITIALIZING] → [DOWNLOADING_ASSETS] → ASSETS_READY → [VM_STARTING →
  VM_READY] → NETWORK_READY → READY` (or `FAILED`). Bracketed phases are
  conditional; the VM pair is skipped entirely by a `--no-linux-vm`
  daemon, which boots no guest. `DEGRADED` is reserved and never emitted.
- A phase the daemon had already left before a client subscribed is never
  observed. Treat a missing phase as unknown, not as zero elapsed and not
  as a reason to keep waiting — the stream never replays it. Once
  subscribed, though, no transition is dropped: `WatchSetupStatus` streams
  every update rather than the newest snapshot, because `NETWORK_READY` and
  `READY` are published ~300 µs apart with no await point between them and
  a snapshot channel would collapse them (see `SetupState` in
  `arcbox-api/src/system.rs`).
- `NETWORK_READY` covers whichever host services this daemon promises. A
  `--no-linux-vm` daemon reaches it with DNS alone. DNS, Docker, and an
  explicitly requested Kubernetes proxy or SSH server (`--kubernetes-port`,
  `--ssh-port`) are *bound* by then; a bind failure becomes `FAILED`. The
  canonical best-effort ports 16443 and 16022 remain the exception: a
  conflict leaves Kubernetes RPCs, or `ssh <machine>@arcbox`, unavailable
  without failing startup. The SSH server runs with or without the Linux VM:
  machines are VMs of their own.
- A non-default container CIDR is reconciled before runtime services start;
  an existing route owned by another interface fails startup. The canonical
  production CIDR keeps its existing background recovery behavior.
- `--docker-integration` is production-only. Its global Docker context switch
  runs after startup-critical recovery, so a resolver failure cannot leave a
  dead ArcBox context selected.
- Enum ordinal ≠ progression order (`DOWNLOADING_ASSETS = 8` occurs before
  `READY = 6`). Clients must match on the value, never compare ordinals.
  New phases are appended with the next free number regardless of where
  they sit in the progression — values are additive-only.
- Phases mark the transitions; the boolean `SetupStatus` fields
  (`vm_running`, `route_installed`, `dns_resolver_installed`, …) carry the
  state that outlives startup, including work `recovery::run` spawns in
  the background and anything `route_status_loop` reconciles afterwards.
  A client wanting "is the route up *now*" reads the flag, not a phase.
  `vm_running` and `route_installed` both track the VM across restarts —
  `services::vm_running_loop` mirrors `VmLifecycleState::is_ready`, and
  `route_status_loop` mirrors the route events — so both fall on a
  lifecycle-managed stop and rise again on the next boot rather than
  reporting one cold-start observation forever. Neither is a liveness probe:
  a guest that dies without the lifecycle noticing leaves `vm_running` true,
  because crash detection is unimplemented (ABX-414).

### Why gRPC starts before resource cleanup

The desktop app polls the daemon's gRPC `WatchSetupStatus` stream with a
30 s timeout. If gRPC were started after stale-daemon cleanup (which can
block for up to 40 s), the desktop would time out. Moving gRPC earlier
lets clients observe the full phase progression in real time.

## Daemon Lock (`daemon.lock`)

Exclusive ownership is managed by a POSIX advisory lock (`flock(2)`) on
`~/.arcbox/run/daemon.lock`. The lock file also stores the current PID
for diagnostics.

### Properties

- **Kernel-managed**: released automatically on process exit, crash, or
  SIGKILL. No stale-lock scenarios are possible.
- **Reentrant-safe**: the file is never deleted. New daemons reuse it.
- **Non-blocking probe**: `flock(LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB)` tests whether
  another daemon is alive without polling.

### Acquisition flow

```
open(daemon.lock, O_CREAT | O_RDWR)
    │
flock(LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB)
    ├─ success → no stale daemon, proceed
    └─ EWOULDBLOCK → lock held
        │
        read PID from file
        │
        is_arcbox_daemon(pid)?
        ├─ yes → SIGTERM, wait up to 30 s, SIGKILL fallback
        └─ no  → log warning, wait for lock release
        │
        flock(LOCK_EX)   ← blocks until holder exits
        │
write current PID
```

## Graceful Shutdown (SIGTERM / Ctrl+C)

```
signal received
  ├─ cancel CancellationToken         → all services begin draining
  ├─ drain(DNS, Docker, gRPC)         → 5 s timeout, then abort
  ├─ runtime.shutdown()
  │   ├─ stop port forwarders
  │   ├─ vm_lifecycle.shutdown()       → graceful VM stop; bridge routes expire
  │   ├─ stop remaining machines
  │   └─ network_manager.stop()
  ├─ DockerContextManager.disable()   → remove Docker CLI integration
  ├─ cleanup_files()                  → delete docker.sock, arcbox.sock
  │                                     daemon.lock kept (flock auto-releases)
  └─ process exits
```

### Residual state after graceful exit

| File | State | Next startup |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `daemon.lock` | exists, old PID, **lock released** | `try_flock` succeeds instantly |
| `docker.sock` | deleted | — |
| `arcbox.sock` | deleted | — |
| disk images (`docker.img` + `docker-meta.img`, Rosetta counterparts) | exist, no holders | — |
| VM | gracefully stopped | — |

No manual intervention needed.

## Signal During Startup

The signal watcher is armed before the startup pipeline runs (`main::run`
selects the pipeline against `wait_for_signal`), so SIGTERM / Ctrl+C
arriving mid-startup triggers an orderly abort instead of the default
kill-and-orphan:

```
signal received during startup
  ├─ SetupState.set_failed("startup interrupted…")  → WatchSetupStatus clients see the cause
  ├─ cancel CancellationToken                       → gRPC (if started) drains
  ├─ early_runtime empty?  → exit (nothing to tear down)
  ├─ runtime.shutdown()    → bounded to 10 s: an in-flight boot parks
  │                          graceful Stop behind itself, so an unbounded
  │                          wait could last the whole boot timeout
  └─ on timeout / second signal → runtime.shutdown_force()  → VM killed,
                                  no orphaned XPC helpers holding disk images
```

`early_runtime` is filled right after `Runtime` construction, before the
VM boots, so it covers every window in which a VM can exist.

The daemon lease survives the abort: the lock is shared into the
pre-pipeline handles when acquired, so cancelling the startup future
does not release the flock — a concurrent daemon cannot take the lease
while this process is still tearing down its VM. The flock releases at
process exit, as in every other path.

## Crash / SIGKILL

When the daemon is killed without graceful shutdown:

- `flock` is released by the kernel (fd closed).
- Socket files are **not** cleaned up.
- VM is **not** gracefully stopped.
- Container subnet route is **not** removed.
- The disk images (`docker.img`, `docker-meta.img`, Rosetta counterparts) may still be held by Virtualization.framework XPC helpers.

### Residual state after crash

| File | State | Next startup |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `daemon.lock` | exists, old PID, **lock released** | `try_flock` succeeds instantly |
| `docker.sock` | **stale** | `DockerApiServer::bind` removes before bind |
| `arcbox.sock` | **stale** | `start_grpc` removes before bind |
| disk images | **possibly held by XPC helpers** | `wait_for_resources` waits up to 10 s |
| VM | non-graceful termination | Virtualization.framework cleans up |
| Route | **stale** | `recovery::run()` rebuilds |

All residual state is handled automatically on next startup. No manual
intervention needed.

## Stale Daemon Takeover

When a new daemon starts while an old one is still running:

1. `acquire_lock` detects the held lock.
2. Reads the old PID from `daemon.lock`.
3. Verifies it is an arcbox-daemon process (`libproc::pidpath`).
4. Sends SIGTERM → old daemon begins graceful shutdown.
5. Waits up to 30 s for the old daemon to exit.
6. Falls back to SIGKILL if unresponsive.
7. Acquires the lock once released.
8. `start_grpc` removes any stale sockets before binding.
9. `wait_for_resources` waits for disk-image holders to release.

The old daemon's graceful shutdown runs its full sequence (drain, VM stop,
socket cleanup). The new daemon only needs to handle the disk-image
holdover case.

## Socket Lifecycle

Each server owns its socket file. Sockets are **not** cleaned up
centrally during startup — each server removes and rebinds independently:

| Socket | Owner | Cleanup |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `arcbox.sock` | `services::start_grpc` | `remove_file` before `UnixListener::bind` |
| `docker.sock` | `DockerApiServer::bind` | `remove_file` before `UnixListener::bind` |

This avoids race conditions where a centralized cleanup could delete a
socket that another component has already bound.

## Edge Cases

### Disk images held by orphaned XPC helpers

Virtualization.framework spawns XPC helper processes that may outlive the
daemon. These processes hold the disk images (`docker.img`, `docker-meta.img`, Rosetta counterparts) open. The daemon waits up to
10 s for them to exit (`wait_for_resources`), then proceeds. If they
persist, `init_runtime` may fail because the disk image is locked.

**Manual fix**: `ps aux | grep -i virtualization` and kill the orphaned
helpers, then restart the daemon.

The daemon does **not** SIGKILL these processes automatically because
forceful termination risks corrupting the guest filesystem.

### Lock held by non-arcbox process

If `daemon.lock` is held by a process that is not an arcbox-daemon (e.g.,
a debugger or strace wrapper), `acquire_lock` logs a warning and blocks
until the lock is released. It does not send signals to non-arcbox
processes.

### PID reuse

With `flock`, PID reuse is not a concern. The lock is tied to the file
descriptor, not the PID. Even if the kernel reuses a PID for an unrelated
process, the new daemon detects that the lock is not held (because the
original holder's fd was closed on exit) and proceeds immediately.

The CLI (`abctl daemon status/stop/start`) also uses `flock` probing
(`LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB`) rather than `kill(pid, 0)` for liveness detection.
PID is only read from the lock file for SIGTERM delivery and display.

### Spawn serialization (`daemon-spawn.lock`)

The alive probe releases its flock immediately, so two racing
`abctl daemon start` invocations could both observe "not running" and
both spawn a daemon — the flock loser would then displace the winner
mid-boot via the stale-daemon takeover. To close this TOCTOU, the CLI
holds a separate `daemon-spawn.lock` (in the run directory) from the
alive check until the spawned daemon owns `daemon.lock` (bounded by a
10 s handoff timeout). A concurrent start blocks on the spawn lock and
then re-checks liveness, reporting "already running" instead of
spawning a duplicate. `daemon.lock` itself remains exclusively the
daemon's resource.

launchd (`RunAtLoad`/`KeepAlive`) does not take the spawn lock; a
launchd-vs-CLI race still resolves through the daemon-side takeover,
which is orderly now that signals are handled during startup.
